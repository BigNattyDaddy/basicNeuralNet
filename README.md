# basicNeuralNet

First basic 1 x 15 x 1 neural net that shows signs of being capable of learning directions of functions. By tweaking the learning rate to its most efficient, the net learns
either increasing or decreasing of a function when replicating it. 


A certain mathematical function is given to the net (examples used are sin, x^2, x^0.5, x^0.1, etc.). the net has shown that the replicated function was positively increasing 
trained with positive square root function, for instance, but decreasing when trained with -x^0.5.
